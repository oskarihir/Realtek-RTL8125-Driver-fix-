# 🌐 Realtek RTL8125 Driver Fix for Linux Kernel 6.9.3-76060903-generic https://www.realtek.com/Download/ToDownload?type=direct&downloadid=3763

## 📄 Overview

This repository provides a solution to resolve compilation issues when building the Realtek RTL8125 network driver on Linux kernel `6.9.3-76060903-generic`. The primary problem stems from incompatible function pointer types in the driver source code, leading to build errors.

## 🚨 Problem Description

When attempting to compile the RTL8125 driver on Linux kernel `6.9.3-76060903-generic`, you might encounter errors like the following:

```bash
/home/user/r8125-9.013.02/src/r8125_n.c:7682:20: error: initialization of ‘int (*)(struct net_device *, struct ethtool_keee *)’ from incompatible pointer type ‘int (*)(struct net_device *, struct ethtool_eee *)’ [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
 7682 |         .get_eee = rtl_ethtool_get_eee,
      |                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/home/user/r8125-9.013.02/src/r8125_n.c:7682:20: note: (near initialization for ‘rtl8125_ethtool_ops.get_eee’)
/home/user/r8125-9.013.02/src/r8125_n.c:7683:20: error: initialization of ‘int (*)(struct net_device *, struct ethtool_keee *)’ from incompatible pointer type ‘int (*)(struct net_device *, struct ethtool_eee *)’ [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
 7683 |         .set_eee = rtl_ethtool_set_eee,
      |                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/home/user/r8125-9.013.02/src/r8125_n.c:7683:20: note: (near initialization for ‘rtl8125_ethtool_ops.set_eee’)
```

These errors occur because the function pointer types for `.get_eee` and `.set_eee` do not match the expected types in the kernel.

## 🛠️ Solution

To fix this issue, you need to modify the source code by casting the function pointers to the expected types. This repository contains the necessary patch and step-by-step instructions to resolve the problem.

## 🔧 Steps to Apply the Fix

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oskarihir/Realtek-RTL8125-Driver-fix-.git
cd rtl8125-kernel6.9.3-fix
```

### 2. Rebuild the Driver

Clean any previous build artifacts and rebuild the driver:

```bash
make clean
sudo ./autorun.sh
```

### 3. Install and Load the Driver

The `autorun.sh` script will install the driver. After installation, load it using:

```bash
sudo modprobe r8125
```

### 4. Verify the Installation

Ensure the driver is correctly installed and loaded by running:

```bash
lsmod | grep r8125
ifconfig
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the build or installation process, please ensure:

- Your system is up-to-date with all necessary dependencies installed.
- You are using the correct kernel headers for `6.9.3-76060903-generic`.

If problems persist, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
